    "# Attention Mechanisms and Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "One major drawback of recurrent networks is that all words in a sequence have the same impact on the result. This causes sub-optimal performance with standard LSTM encoder-decoder models for sequence to sequence tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition and Machine Translation. In reality specific words in the input sequence often have more impact on sequential outputs than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider sequence-to-sequence model, such as machine translation. It is implemented by two recurrent networks, where one network (**encoder**) would collapse input sequence into hidden state, and another one, **decoder**, would unroll this hidden state into translated result. The problem with this approach is that final state of the network would have hard time remembering the beginning of a sentence, thus causing poor quality of the model on long sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Mechanisms** provide a means of weighting the contextual impact of each input vector on each output prediction of the RNN. The way it is implemented is by creating shortcuts between intermediate states of the input RNN, and output RNN. In this manner, when generating output symbol $y_t$, we will take into account all input hidden states $h_i$, with different weight coefficients $\\alpha_{t,i}$. \n",

    "Attention mechanisms are responsible for much of the current or near current state of the art in Natural language processing. Adding attention however greatly increases the number of model parameters which led to scaling issues with RNNs. A key constraint of scaling RNNs is that the recurrent nature of the models makes it challenging to batch and parelleize training. In an RNN each element of a sequence needs to be processed in sequential order which means it cannot be easily parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adoption of attention mechanisms combined with this constraint led to the creation of the now State of the Art Transformer Models that we know and use today from BERT to OpenGPT3.\n",

    "## Tranformer Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of forwarding the context of each previous prediction into the next evaluation step, **transformer models** use **positonal encodings** and attention to capture the context of a given input with in a provided window of text. The image below shows how positional encodings with attention can capture context within a given window.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/transformer_explination.gif) \n",
    "\n",
    "Since each input position is mapped independently to each output position, transformers can parallelize better than RNNs, which enables much larger and more expressive language models. Each attention head can be used to learn different relationships between words that improves downstream Natural Language Processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a very large multi layer transformer network with 12 layers for *BERT-base*, and 24 for *BERT-large*. The model is first pre-trained on large corpus of text data (WikiPedia + books) using un-superwised training (predicting masked words in a sentence). During pre-training the model absorbs significant level of language understanding which can then be leveraged with other datasets using fine tuning. This process is called **transfer learning**. \n",
