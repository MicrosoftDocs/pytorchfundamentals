    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their gated cell variants such as Long Short Term Memory Cells (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) provided a mechanism for language modeling, i.e. they can learn word ordering and provide predictions for next word in a sequence. This allows us to use RNNs for **generative tasks**, such as ordinary text generation, machine translation, and even image captioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RNN architecture we discussed in the previous unit, each RNN unit produced next next hidden state as an output. However, we can also add another output to each recurrent unit, which would allow us to output a **sequence** (which is equal in length to the original sequence). Moreover, we can use RNN units that do not accept an input at each step, and just take some initial state vector, and then produce a sequence of outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **One-to-one** is a traditional neural network with one input and one output\n",
    "* **One-to-many** is a generative architecture that accepts one input value, and generates a sequence of output values. For example, if we want to train **image captioning** network that would produce a textual description of a picture, we can a picture as input, pass it through CNN to obtain hidden state, and then have recurrent chain generate caption word-by-word\n",
    "* **Many-to-one** corresponds to RNN architectures we described in the previous unit, such as text classification\n",
    "* **Many-to-many**, or **sequence-to-sequence** corresponds to tasks such as **machine translation**, where we have first RNN collect all information from the input sequence into the hidden state, and another RNN chain unrolls this state into the output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit, we will focus on simple generative models that help us generate text. For simplicity, let's build **character-level network**, which generates text letter by letter. During training, we need to take some text corpus, and split it into letter sequences. "

    "We have introduced one more parameter called **temperature**, which is used to indicate how hard we should stick to the highest probability. If temperature is 1.0, we do fair multinomial sampling, and when temperature goes to infinity - all probabilities become equal, and we randomly select next character. In the example below we can observe that the text becomes meaningless when we increase the temparature too much, and it resembles \"cycled\" hard-generated text when it becomes closer to 0. "
