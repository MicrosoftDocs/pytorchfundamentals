    "In the previous module, we have been using rich semantic representations of text, and a simple linear classifier on top of the embeddings. What this architecture does is to capture aggregated meaning of words in a sentence, but it does not take into account the **order** of words, because aggregation operation on top of embeddings removed this information from the original text. Because these models are unable to model word ordering, they cannot solve more complex or ambiguous tasks such as text generation or question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the meaning of text sequence, we need to use another neural network architecture, which is caller **recurrent neural network**, or RNN. In RNN, we pass our sentence through the network one symbol at a time, and the network produces some **state**, which we then pass to the network again with the next symbol.\n",

    "Given the input sequence of tokens $X_0,\\dots,X_n$, RNN creates a sequence of neural network blocks, and trains this sequence end-to-end using back propagation. Each network block takes a pair $(X_i,S_i)$ as an input, and produces $S_{i+1}$ as a result. Final state $S_n$ or output $X_n$ goes into a linear classifier to produce the result. All network blocks share the same weights, and are trained end-to-end using one backpropagation pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because state vectors $S_0,\\dots,S_n$ are passed through the network, it is able to learn the sequential dependencies between words. For example, when the word *not* appears somewhere in the sequnce, it can learn to negate certain elements within the state vector, resulting in negation.  \n",

    "## Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main problems of classical RNNs is so-called **vanishing gradients** problem. Because RNNs are trained end-to-end in one back-propagation pass, it is having hard times propagating error to the first layers of the network, and thus the network cannot learn relationships between distant tokens. One of the ways to avoid this problem is to introduce **explicit state management** by using so called **gates**. There are two most known architectures of this kind: **Long Short Term Memory** (LSTM) and **Gated Relay Unit** (GRU).\n",
    "\n",
    "![LSTM Cell](../images/The_LSTM_Cell.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM Network is organized in a manner similar to RNN, but there are two states that are being passed from layer to layer: actual state $c$, and hidden vector $h$. At each unit, hidden vector $h_i$ is concatenated with input $x_i$, and they control what happens to the state $c$ via **gates**. Each gate is a neural network with sigmoid activation (output in the range $[0,1]$), which can be thought of as bitwise mask when multiplied by the state vector. There are the following gates (from left to right on the picture above):\n",
    "* **forget gate** takes hidden vector and determines, which components of the vector $c$ we need to forget, and which to pass through. \n",
    "* **input gate** takes some information from the input and hidden vector, and inserts it into state.\n",
    "* **output gate** transforms state via some linear layer with $\\tanh$ activation, then selects some of its components using hidden vector $h_i$ to produce new state $c_{i+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components of the state $c$ can be thought of as some flags that can be switched on and off. For example, when we encounter a name *Alice* in the sequece, we may want to assume that it refers to female character, and raise the flag in the state that we have female noun in the sentence. When we further encounter phrases *and Tom*, we will raise the flag that we have plural noun. Thus by manipulating state we can supposedly keep track of grammatical properties of sentence parts.\n",

    "While internal structure of LSTM cell may look complex, PyTorch hides this implementation inside `LSTMCell` class, and provides `LSTM` object to represent the whole LSTM layer. Thus, implementation of LSTM classifier will be pretty similar to the simple RNN which we have seen above:"

    "## Bidirectional and Multilayer RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "In our examples, all recurrent networks operated in one direction, from beginning of a sequence to the end. It looks natural, because it resembles the way we read and listen to speech. However, since in many practical cases we have random access to the input sequence, it might make sense to run recurrent computation in both directions. Such networks are call **bidirectional** RNNs, and they can be created by passing `bidirectional=True` parameter to RNN/LSTM/GRU constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with bidirectional network, we would need two hidden state vectors, one for each direction. PyTorch encodes those vectors as one vector of twice larger size, which is quite convenient, because you would normally pass the resulting hidden state to fully-connected linear layer, and you would just need to take this increase in size into account when creating the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent network, one-directional or bidirectional, captures certain patterns within a sequence, and can store them into state vector or pass into output. As with convolutional networks, we can build another recurrent layer on top of the first one to capture higher level patterns, build from low-level patterns extracted by the first layer. This leads us to the notion of **multi-layer RNN**, which consists of two or more recurrent networks, where output of the previous layer is passed to the next layer as input.\n",

    "PyTorch makes constructing such networks an easy task, because you just need to pass `num_layers` parameter to RNN/LSTM/GRU constructor to build several layers of recurrence automatically.
