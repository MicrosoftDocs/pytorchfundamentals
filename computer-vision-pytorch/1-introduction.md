# Introduction to Computer Vision Using PyTorch

> Author: [Dmitry Soshnikov](http://soshnikov.com) 

Computer Vision is one of the most useful applications of Artificial Intelligence. Nowadays, neural networks are successfully used in many tasks, such as detecting road signs in self-driving cars, counting products on a conveyor belt, or making sure people are wearing masks when needed. 

In this module, we will learn how to perform different computer vision tasks using [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org), one of the most popular library for building neural networks. We will mostly focus on **Image Classification**, so by the end of this course you would be able to solve problems such as handwritten digit recognition, or determining different breeds of dogs on the picture.

We will first learn how to represent images as tensors and see if traditional neural network can be used for classification. We will then introduce a special neural network type for image processing - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and see how they can improve the accuracy and make classification work for real-life images. We will see how pre-trained networks can be used to solve real-world problems such as classifying cats and dogs, with relatively small training datasets.
