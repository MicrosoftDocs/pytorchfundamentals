# PyTorch Fundamentals - Introduction

Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, optimizing model parameters, and saving the trained models. This module introduces you to a complete ML workflow implemented in PyTorch. Weâ€™ll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, or Ankle boot.

Before we jump into building the model you will be guided through a set of core concepts needed to understand the basics of building Machine Learning models. Then the last step will put it all together.
