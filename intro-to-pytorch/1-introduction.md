# Introduction to PyTorch

> Author: [Seth Juarez](https://www.sethjuarez.com/) 

Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, optimizing model parameters, and saving the trained models. This module introduces you to a complete ML workflow implemented in PyTorch. Weâ€™ll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, or Ankle boot.

Before we jump into building the model you will be guided through the below list of core concepts needed to understand the basics of building Machine Learning models. Then the last step will put it all together.

# Learning objectives
